Bug 04: I think we have a major bug in all pages.

* Make sure all pages are calling the backend properly, they are calling the backend to load data. Make sure they are calling the backend to create data.
* Revisit all pages, I dont think frontend is calling backend to create data or load data.
* Review backend code and make sure we are calling the right endpoints.
* Check for any console errors or network issues in the browser's developer tools.
* Ensure that the API endpoints are correctly defined and accessible.
* Verify that the frontend is correctly handling the responses from the backend.
